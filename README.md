# DBNTensorFlow - a Deep Belief Network implementation with TensorFlow

This repository contains unsupervised implementations of a Restriced Boltzmann Machine and a Deep Belief Network,
 including unsupervised fine-tuning of a Deep Belief Network. The implementation uses Python 2.7 and
 the [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org) framework, which is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
 The code started out from Gabriele Angeletti's [Deep-Learning-TensorFlow](https://github.com/blackecho/Deep-Learning-TensorFlow/) project which has implementations
 for a bunch of different Deep Learning techniques, so have a look at his GitHub repo!

The code herein was part of a MSc thesis project and was used for unsupervised feature-extraction from
multi-wavelength image data from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://www.sdss.org/) database, Data Release 12.

Feel free to use it for your own projects or for your personal learning, but I leave no guarantees of its correctness or
suitability in any way. Please see the LICENSE.txt document for the terms of this software. And please be nice and give
me credit in any projects and/or publications. :)

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome, though I may or may not have the time to look at them.


### Requirements:

* Python 2.7
* tensorflow >= 0.8
* NumPy 1.11.0
* SciPy 0.13.3

The implementations have only been tested on Ubuntu but should probably
work on any OS that you can get TensorFlow running on.
